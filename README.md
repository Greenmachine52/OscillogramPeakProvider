This repository is a heavily reworked version of https://github.com/naudio/NAudio.WaveFormRenderer/ .
All credits go to the original author.

What I wanted to achieve is completly remove all the rendering and rather provide data for external clients.
Another added feature is the divider service to divide a monoFile into two channels to then be used to provide information
on each channel seperatly.
